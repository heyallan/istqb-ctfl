			<legend>Question #3</legend>
			<p class="question">You are deciding on the functional test automation approach for a highly complex system which is expected to be used in production for many years. You have already conducted a survey with the major tool vendors and you have determined that you will not be able to use any of their tools to create your test automation due to the non-standard interfaces that were required for the software. You and the developers have decided that your best automation approach will be through custom interfaces implemented specifically for testing.

				What are two concerns you should have with this approach?</p>
			<label><input id="3a" name="3" type="radio" value="1">a) If the interfaces are not disabled before release, there could be a security risk</label>
			<label><input id="3b" name="3" type="radio" value="0">b) The performance of the test interfaces may be much faster than the performance of the real interfaces</label>
			<label><input id="3c" name="3" type="radio" value="0">c) The effort spent to develop test automation will not be justified by the expected lifespan of the code in production</label>
			<label><input id="3d" name="3" type="radio" value="1">d) Because there is a high level of intrusion, there may be false alarms generated</label>
			<label><input id="3e" name="3" type="radio" value="0">e) Because there is a low level of intrusion, the test results will not be representative of the production code</label>
			<div class="explanation">
				<div class="font-weight-700">Answer:</div>
				<div class="answer">a) Is correct. A is noted in section 3.2.3 of the syllabus where it talks about checking for security risks if you leave test interfaces in place
					b) Is not correct. We are testing the code, not the performance
					c) Is not correct. It is stated in the question that this is a long-lived, complex product
					d) Is correct. Developing custom test interfaces is considered a high level of intrusion and this may generate false alarms due to the different code being exercised
					e) Is not correct. The custom interfaces introduce a high level of intrusion</div>

			<legend>Question #4</legend>
			<p class="question">You have been automating a legacy application that provides critical functionality to the business. An update to the legacy system has been approved and the developers plan to use third party software to provide the new functionality. The third party software has already been tested but the interface between the existing software and the new software is problematic. Your existing test automation needs to be extended to test the interface between these two products.

				How should you approach implementing the best automation solution?</p>
			<label><input id="4a" name="4" type="radio" value="0">a) Develop test automation for the entire system including the legacy and third party applications</label>
			<label><input id="4b" name="4" type="radio" value="1">b) Investigate if automation is possible via the APIs used to interface with the third party software</label>
			<label><input id="4c" name="4" type="radio" value="0">c) Develop new automation to test via the GUI of the third party software</label>
			<label><input id="4d" name="4" type="radio" value="0">d) Investigate if automation can be implemented using the CLI to replace the existing GUI automation</label>
			<div class="explanation">
				<div class="font-weight-700">Answer:</div>
				<div class="answer">a) Is not correct. There is no reason to fully automate the testing of the third party system
					b) Is correct. If APIs are available automation at the API, level makes sense
					c) Is not correct. We are not testing the GUI of the third party software
					d) Is not correct. This is not a logical approach</div>

			<legend>Question #5</legend>
			<p class="question">You are evaluating functional test automation tools. The tool that you prefer can provide your organization with a favorable cost-benefit ratio, which appeals to senior management. Additionally, you feel the tool is superior in meeting your other technical criteria. However, the tool has many features most of which will never be used. As a result, you feel this makes the tool overly complex and confusing.

				What should your next steps be regarding selection of this tool?</p>
			<label><input id="5a" name="5" type="radio" value="0">a) Consider another tool that is more user friendly</label>
			<label><input id="5b" name="5" type="radio" value="1">b) Explore the possibility of configuring the tool to turn off unnecessary features</label>
			<label><input id="5c" name="5" type="radio" value="0">c) Plan to supplement selection of this tool with lengthy and comprehensive training sessions</label>
			<label><input id="5d" name="5" type="radio" value="0">d) Consider acquiring an additional tool that can provide a more user friendly interface to the preferred tool</label>
			<div class="explanation">
				<div class="font-weight-700">Answer:</div>
				<div class="answer">a) Is not correct. The preferred tool meets your criteria, finding another tool may be difficult
					b) Is correct. Tools are often configurable and allow functionality to be hidden
					c) Is not correct. Training sessions take away from testing time and the need for training would continue for the life of the tool, which would be an expensive alternative
					d) Is not correct. Additional tool costs, configuration, and maintenance would make this an unacceptable alternative</div>

			<legend>Question #6</legend>
			<p class="question">When a system is designed for testability, one of the characteristics is that the test cases can access interfaces into the system that can be used to verify the expected behavior actually occurred as a result of the test.

				What is this characteristic called?</p>
			<label><input id="6a" name="6" type="radio" value="1">a) Observability</label>
			<label><input id="6b" name="6" type="radio" value="0">b) Controllability</label>

			<div class="explanation">
				<div class="font-weight-700">Answer:</div>
				<div class="answer">a) Is correct. A system that allows visibility to the results of a test has the property of observability
					b) Is not correct. Because controllability is the ability of the interface to control behavior of the system
					c) Is not correct. Because they are quality characteristics rather than specific testability characteristics
					d) Is not correct. Because they are quality characteristics rather than specific testability characteristics</div>

			<legend>Question #9</legend>
			<p class="question">You are working on the design of a test automation project. The gTAA was set up by a consulting company prior to your being hired. You are now looking to create the TAA from the gTAA.

				You have the following requirements that must be addressed by your TAA:

				1. The TAA must support independence across technologies. It is likely that this same test suite will be used in different test environments and on different target technologies
				2. The test artifacts need to be portable
				3. Vendor-neutrality is preferable
				4. It is vitally important that the TAA be maintainable and maintenance costs be minimized
				5. It is preferred that less technical people be able to maintain the system even though highly technical people have built it
				6. There is a large project budget for this effort for the next two years, but the budget will decrease after that time

				Given these requirements, which one of the following should the TAE consider during the implementation of the TAA?</p>
			<label><input id="9a" name="9" type="radio" value="0">a) The communication protocols used by the <abbr title="Test Automation Solution">TAS</abbr> to interact with the SUT</label>

			<label><input id="10d" name="10" type="radio" value="0">d) The test definition layer will supply the adaptation necessary for the tests to run with various tools and interfaces</label>
			<div class="explanation">
				<div class="font-weight-700">Answer:</div>
				<div class="answer">a) Is not correct. Separating the two does not have anything to do with speed of execution
					b) Is correct. By separating the definition from the execution, the definition is immune from the tool selection and usage. If another tool is used, the definition does not have to change â€“ only the execution layer will change. See section 3.1.1
					c) Is not correct. Test cases are not added during execution
					d) Is not correct. Adaptation is supplied by the adaptation layer</div>

Software quality is good on the quarterly releases, but there is concern that the time required for the regression testing is not cost effective and is inhibiting the flow of new features. You see several challenges in this implementation, the greatest of which is the creation and preservation of test data. While the test environments are stable and controlled, the test data is frequently refreshed from production, which makes it difficult to write maintainable test automation.

				Given this information, which of the following is most likely to be a problem for this test automation effort?</p>
			<label><input id="29a" name="29" type="radio" value="0">a) Maturity of the test process</label>
